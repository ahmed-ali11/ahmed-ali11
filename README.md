## ðŸš€ Hello, it's me Ahmed Ali




## About me
I'm a data analytics who enjoys integrating my previous work experience into understanding and extracting insights from data. I have been practicing my learnings by working on projects for cleaning, assessing, visualizing, and getting insights from raw data for almost two years. I'd love to combine my passion for problem-solving and numbers with my communication and analysis skills to extract useful insights that can impact businesses. Right now, I am practicing on projects to progress my skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau.
